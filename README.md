# How to Play
The player needs to reach the water by avoiding any collision with the bugs/enemies crossing the road. The movement of the player can be controlled using the *Left*, *Right*, *Down*, and *Up* arrow keys in the keyboard.
The rules for the game are:

1. The player has 30 seconds
2. Each time the player reaches the water she/he get 10 points
3. If the player hits a bug/enemy, 5 points are deducted from his current score. However, the score of the player does not go to a negative value. After hitting a bug/enemy, the player starts from her/his initial position
4. At the end of the game (after 30 seconds), the player can choose to play again or quit
